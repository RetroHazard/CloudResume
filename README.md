## Summary
The Cloud Resume Challenge was developed by Forrest Brazeal and is a loosely defined, objective based Cloud Project, setting a number of goals within predefined chunks, while avoiding the trap of being too hand-holdy; The Challenge can be adressed in as simple or complex terms as one chooses, so long as the objective(s) are met.
Completing this Challenge requires a multi-disciplinary approach, covering a wide variety of topics, including (but not limited to): 
+ Fullstack Development
+ Testing
+ Automation
+ Infrastructure
+ Architecture
+ Security
+ Source Control
+ Documentation
+ etc.

The entire challenge culminated in my developing a Single Page WebApp /w API integration, architecting and connecting a variety of AWS services, developing website test scripts, learning how to utilize Infrastructure-as-Code using Terraform, and many other skills.
When I first started this project, I had nearly zero experience in every single technology stack that I leveraged. What began as a way to help reinforce the AWS courses I was following, ended up being a incredibly fun personal project and I'm looking forward to finding the next one.
